## Abstract

> If you are a Shiny developer, chances are you've created a dashboard app.
> Dashboards are probably the most popular type of Shiny app, and they allow you to display and interact with data in a visually appealing and intuitive way.
>
> In this talk, we will show you how bslib can make stunning dashboards with Shiny.
> Not only is bslib a package that pairs with Shiny to provide up-to-date and themable versions of Bootstrap, but bslib has evolved to include a range of components and layouts that are specifically designed for creating delightful dashboards.
> Recently, we've begun recommending Shiny developers turn to bslib instead of shinydashboard, the long time standard dashboarding package for Shiny.
>
> We will cover all of the latest exciting developments in bslib, including the recently unveiled new default Shiny look and feel.
