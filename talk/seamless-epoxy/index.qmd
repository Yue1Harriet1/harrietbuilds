## Abstract

> {epoxy} is a new R package that allows report authors to seamless blend prose
> and data in markdown, HTML, and LaTeX reports. {epoxy} builds on the excellent
> tools for data-driven reporting provided by R Markdown, Quarto and Shiny,
> while saving report authors from tedious and repetitive data formatting tasks.
> This talk will highlight the many ways that {epoxy} can help data scientists
> in medicine to streamline reports, articles, and Shiny apps.
