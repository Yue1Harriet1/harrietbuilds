High-quality research data provisioning requires\n> skilled navigation of heterogeneous software systems and a detailed\n> understanding of data structure standards within each source. In this talk we\n> discuss how we, as honest brokers at a large cancer center, have created a\n> universe of internal R packages that simplify data access, store and present\n> metadata, standardize best practices, support reproducibility and\n> repeatability, apply branding styles to reports and visualizations, and\n> facilitate communication with the research data end user. Our package\n> ecosystem simplifies the workflow of honest brokers to scale curation and\n> delivery of high-quality research data.",
