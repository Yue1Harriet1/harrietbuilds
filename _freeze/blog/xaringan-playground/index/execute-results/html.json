CSS\n\nOver the last few years, I've built many presentations with <span class=\"pkg\">[xaringan]</span>.\nThere are a lot of things to love about <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span>,\nbut one thing I've noticed is that <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span> presentations\ncan be a gateway into the world of web development.\n\nIf you've worked with [R Markdown][rmarkdown] to create a report or blog or website to share online,\nyou've probably encountered a few stylistic things you've wanted to change.\nThese changes tend to be small,\nlike choosing a new font family or changing the color of links.\nIf you don't like the look of your report,\nthere are [lots of themes to choose from](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)\nin <span class=\"pkg\">rmarkdown</span>, or in other packages like\n[prettydocs](https://prettydoc.statr.me/),\n[rmdformats](https://github.com/juba/rmdformats),\nor [cleanrmd](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/cleanrmd/).\n\n<span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span> is a little different.\nSlides are a visual medium.\nYou probably have an idea of how you want your slides to look as you work on them.\n\nYou can get really far with plain markdown using the few little extras that <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span> provides,\nbut at a certain point in the process of transferring your vision of your talk to the screen,\nyou've probably said,\nout loud and not without a slight hint of frustration:\n_I just want that thing to go right **there**_.\n\nIn point-and-click software, this is where you'd spend some time dragging text and images around or digging through menus to make your slides look awesome.\nIn <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span>, your slides are web page,\nso we instead need to turn to CSS to style our slides.\nI'm not going to say that one method is necessarily better than the other,\njust that I personally love writing code and I actually enjoy CSS.\nI might be weird in that respect,\nbut since you're still reading this I'm guessing you are too.\n\nThis is why I love <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span>.\nEach slide is a small, self-contained web design project.\nThe constraints are well-defined:\nyou aren't building an _entire website_.\nYou don't have to make an app or think about a user interface.\nYou just need to make _this slide_ look great.\n\nThere are two advantages of using <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span> and CSS for our slides that I think are important.\nFirst, knowing CSS is useful in more places than just making slides.\nMany of the things I've designed for a presentation\nhave been useful in other areas of my life as an R Markdown user and person who puts things on the internet for others to enjoy.\n\nSecond, while CSS can be daunting to learn,\nthe stakes are relatively low with <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span>.\nYou don't need to know everything about CSS or web development.\nWhen you create a new slide,\nyou only need to worry about the things you're going to put in that slide.\nYou don't have to think about laying out an entire web page.\nAnd as long as you slides look good when you present them,\nthen your job was well done.\n\nThis is why I see <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span> as a playground for trying new things.\nIt sets you up to play with CSS, to learn something new, and to get quick, immediate feedback.\nPlus, it feels good to make things that look great and to share them with the world!\n\nNot only that, <span class=\"pkg\">xaringan</span> has a few tricks up its sleeve.\nCatch the talk or wait for the next post in this series to learn more!\n",
