Hello, my name is Garrick Aden-Buie.
I’m a Ph.D. Candidate at the [University of South Florida](http://usf.edu/) in Tampa, FL in the [Department of Industrial and Management Sciences Engineering](http://imse.eng.usf.edu/).

I build web apps using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), tools and packages for [R](http://r-project.org), and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
Browse my [list of projects](/project/) for examples of my work, or review my [full curriculum vitae (resume)](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/resume/).

My research interests include

- Data analytics and visualization
- Gerontechnology (aging + technology)
- Healthcare
- Data-driven decision making
- Sustainability
- Urban studies

As an undergrad, I studied at [Lehigh University](http://lehigh.edu/),
in [Bethlehem, PA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown_(song)), only
twenty minutes from where I grew up. There, I received a B.S in Applied
Mathematics. I also spent a year living and studying in Madrid, Spain,
which helped me earn a B.A. in Spanish at Lehigh.  

I am a [Returned Peace Corps Volunteer](http://peacecorps.gov/).
I lived in small town outside of Cuenca, Ecuador where I taught Math, English and life and parenting skills.

I also [write songs and play acoustic guitar](http://garrickadebuie.bandcamp.com/), sometimes [in public](http://www.songkick.com/artists/6913204-garrick-adenbuie).
