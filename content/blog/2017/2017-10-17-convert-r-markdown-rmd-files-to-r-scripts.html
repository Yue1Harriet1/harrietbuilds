<p><strong>tl; super dr:</strong> I’m really not sure how <code>knitr::purl()</code> escaped my attention – maybe I thought it didn’t do something I felt was necessary at the time – but if you’ve stumbled on this page looking for a way to convert an R Markdown file into an R script, then the function you are looking for is called <code>knitr::purl()</code>.</p>
<p>Try <code>knitr::purl(input, output, documentation = 2)</code>. It’s exactly what you’re looking for.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> A <a href="https://gist.github.com/gadenbuie/284671997992aefe295bed34bb53fde6">function called backstitch</a> that backstitches <code>knitr::knit</code>able R Markdown files to <code>knitr::spin</code>able R Scripts.</p>

<p>There are two great ways of writing R Markdown reports.
The most well known way is to use “literate programming”, where the writing and the code are intermingled an <code>.Rmd</code> file.
This is the style of file you get when you create a new “R Markdown” file inside RStudio.</p>
<p>There’s another way of mixing code and writing inside a script, and it’s essentially the inverse of an <code>.Rmd</code> file.</p>
<p>In an R Markdown file, text is considered to be writing unless you wrap it in decoration, by adding backticks around inline code or by putting code in a “code chunk”:</p>
<pre class="markdown"><code>```{r chunk-name}
table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)
```</code></pre>
<p>To get your final report, you call knitr’s <strong><code>knit</code></strong> function, which runs the code chunks, knits the results into the text, and writes an output file (PDF, HTML, Word, etc.).</p>
<p>In the inverse universe, you write your code and text in regular R scripts, mark specific lines as regular text by starting the lines with <code>#'</code>, and you <strong><code>spin</code></strong> your code and text together instead of knitting.</p>
<p>This format is great for computationally-heavy scripts.
The other advantage is that you can call the script directly to run all the code directly, ignoring the text aspect.
I also use it a lot when I want to quickly write up a report on a set of scripts that I’ve been working with.</p>
<p>Dean Attali has a <a href="http://deanattali.com/2015/03/24/knitrs-best-hidden-gem-spin/">great write up from a couple years ago about <code>spin</code></a> that I highly recommend.
And there’s a <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/stitch/">quick intro to <code>spin</code> in the knitr documentation</a>, too.</p>
<p>I usually try to keep computation and reporting scripts separate.
But writing up the results of your code while putting it together is an incredible paradigm for data analysis…and sometimes I keep digging and digging while writing and exploring.
And then I end up with a very “heavy” R Markdown (or notebook), where a lot of the data processing code really should be run separately from the reporting and visualization code.</p>
<p>But how do you convert an R Markdown file to a regular R script (or one that you could <strong><code>spin</code></strong> if you wanted to)?</p>
<p>I couldn’t find the answer online, so I wrote a function called <code>backstitch</code> that does the conversion.
It only goes one way, for now: from <code>.Rmd</code> to <code>.R</code>.
But it lets you convert the whole R Markdown document to an R script, or just pull out the code chunks into a script (or both!).</p>
<p>Because it’s just a function, I made it <a href="https://gist.github.com/gadenbuie/284671997992aefe295bed34bb53fde6">available as a gist</a>, which you can source directly with <code>devtools</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::source_gist(&#39;284671997992aefe295bed34bb53fde6&#39;, filename = &#39;backstitch.R&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Give it an input file or connection (<code>infile</code>), an output file name (<code>outfile</code>, leave as <code>NULL</code> to return as text vector), choose <code>output_type</code> from <code>script</code>, <code>code</code>, <code>both</code> and it does the rest of the work.
(There’s also an extra option called <code>chunk_header</code>, for you to set the initial characters for chunk sections.)</p>
<p>For example, using Yihui’s <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/blob/master/inst/examples/knitr-spin.Rmd">knitr-spin.Rmd</a> example, but in reverse, we start with this file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>This is a special R script which can be used to generate a report. You can
write normal text in roxygen comments.

First we set up some options (you do not have to do this):

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(fig.path = &#39;figure/silk-&#39;)
```

The report begins here.

```{r test-a, cache=FALSE}
# boring examples as usual
set.seed(123)
x = rnorm(5)
mean(x)
```

You can use the special syntax {{code}} to embed inline expressions, e.g.
`r mean(x) + 2`
is the mean of x plus 2.
The code itself may contain braces, but these are not checked.  Thus,
perfectly valid (though very strange) R code such as `{{2 + 3}} - {{4 - 5}}`
can lead to errors because `2 + 3}} - {{4 - 5` will be treated as inline code.

Now we continue writing the report. We can draw plots as well.

```{r test-b, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)); plot(x)
```

Actually you do not have to write chunk options, in which case knitr will use
default options. For example, the code below has no options attached:

```{r }
var(x)
quantile(x)
```

And you can also write two chunks successively like this:

```{r test-chisq5}
sum(x^2) # chi-square distribution with df 5
```{r test-chisq4}
sum((x - mean(x))^2) # df is 4 now
```

Done. Call spin(&#39;knitr-spin.R&#39;) to make silk from sow&#39;s ear now and knit a
lovely purse.</code></pre>
<p>and <code>backstitch</code> it into this file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>infile &lt;- url(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yihui/knitr/master/inst/examples/knitr-spin.Rmd&#39;)
output &lt;- backstitch(infile, output_type = &#39;script&#39;, chunk_header = &quot;#+&quot;)
cat(&quot;```r&quot;, output, &quot;```&quot;, sep = &quot;\n&quot;)</code></pre>
