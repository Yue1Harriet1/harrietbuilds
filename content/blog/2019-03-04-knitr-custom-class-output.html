<p>I was working on customizing CSS classes of output chunks to try to achieve the look of code chunks in Brodie Gaslam’s blog – I really like how input and output are visually connected.
Learned about applying custom css classes to code chunks <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/pull/1335">from Ian Lyttle’s pull request</a> adding support for <code>class.output</code>.
But I quickly discovered that this class is only applied to standard code output, and not the “side effect” chunk outputs, such as messages, warnings and errors.</p>
<p>So I opened <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1676">an issue in knitr</a> and three days later my wishes were granted.
You can now uset the chunk options <code>class.message</code>, <code>class.warning</code>, and <code>class.error</code> to customize the CSS class of outputs of each type.</p>
<p>The new feature will be available in version 1.22 when it makes it to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr">CRAN</a>, or now from <a href="https://github.com/yihui/knitr">GitHub</a></p>
