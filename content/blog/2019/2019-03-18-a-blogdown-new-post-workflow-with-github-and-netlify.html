<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This post presents my workflow for writing new posts for a <span class="pkg"><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown">blogdown</a></span> website hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and served through <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick overview of the workflow:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Draft the post in a new branch, using <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> to preivew locally.</li>
<li>When ready to preview on Netlify, push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request.</li>
<li>Netlify creates a “deploy preview” that can be used to test/view the draft post.</li>
<li>Push additional updates to the post branch as needed and review the updated preview.</li>
<li>Publish the final draft by merging the pull request to the master branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>The post below describes this workflow in more detail, including some <a href="#netlify-toml">critical settings for Netlify</a> that make the process easier.</p>

<h2>Pre-reqs: Workflow Setup</h2>
<div id="bgn" class="section level3">
<h3>Blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify, oh my!</h3>
<p>I’ll assume you have a <span class="pkg"><a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown">blogdown</a></span> website setup already, and in particular a blogdown website published via <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>I highly recommend using Netlify for a number of reasons, primarily because Netlify’s continuous deployment builds your website for you whenever you update your source files.
They also make it easy to set up your website with Let’s Encrypt for https compatibility, and their integration with GitHub make blogdown, GitHub, and Netlify excellent partners.</p>
<p>The process for setting up Netlify to serve your GitHub-hosted blogdown is described in detail in the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html"><em>Netlify</em> section</a> of the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html"><em>Deployment</em> chapter</a> of the blogdown book.
Alison Presmanes Hill’s <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/">Up and running with blogdown</a> is another excellent guide for getting started down this path.</p>
<p>Note that in that process you should end up configuring the <code>baseurl</code> option in your <code>config.toml</code> file.
This is the base of URLs used in your website wherever an absolute URL (rather than a relative URL) is created.
This is somewhat template dependent, but this URL is used wherever a link is parsed with hugo’s <a href="https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/"><code>absURL</code> command</a>.</p>
<p>In my case, <code>baseurl</code> is configured <a href="https://github.com/gadenbuie/garrickadenbuie-com/blob/master/config.toml">like this</a>:</p>
<pre class="toml"><code>baseurl = &quot;https://www.garrickadenbuie.com&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="enable-deploy-previews" class="section level3">
<h3>Enable Deploy Previews</h3>
<p>Netlify provides a feature called <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#deploy-contexts">deploy contexts</a> that allow you to define custom contexts for building your website.
There’s a significant amount of customization you can do with this feature, but the most relevant aspect for this workflow is to enable <em>deploy previews</em>.
When enabled, Netlify will automatically build a preview version of your website for all pull requests.</p>
<p>To turn on this feature, select your website from <a href="https://app.netlify.com/account/sites">your list of sites</a> hosted with Netlify.
Then click on <strong>Site settings</strong> and find <strong>Build &amp; deploy</strong> on the left menu bar.
Under this settings group, click the <em>Edit settings</em> button and select <strong>Automatically build deploy previews for all pull requests</strong> next to <em>Deploy previews</em>.</p>

</div>
<div id="netlify-toml" class="section level3">
<h3>Set up <code>netlify.toml</code></h3>
<p>Finally, you need to create a file called <code>netlify.toml</code> in your website’s root directory.
This file allows you to very specifically customize your Netlify settings in addition to, or in place of, the settings available through the Netlify web app.</p>
<p>The two relevant customizations we want to create are to modify the <code>hugo</code> command used to build the site so that</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>URLs generated by hugo on the deploy preview point to the deploy preview.
This is controlled by adding <code>-b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL</code> to the <code>hugo</code> build command.</p></li>
<li><p>Posts scheduled in the future are also rendered regardless of publication date.
This is controlled by adding <code>--buildFuture</code> to the <code>hugo</code> build command.
You may also wish to enable <code>--buildDrafts</code> as well (but see the <a href="#sidenote-drafts">sidenote on drafts</a> below).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can apply these to the deploy preview context under the <code>context.deploy-preview</code> header, and if you’ve enabled <em>branch deploys</em> in <a href="#enable-deploy-previews">the step above</a>, you can also enable these features under <code>context.branch-deploy</code>.</p>
<p>All together, my <code>netlify.toml</code> file looks like this.</p>
<pre class="toml"><code># netlify.toml
[context.deploy-preview]
command = &quot;hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL --buildFuture&quot;

[context.branch-deploy]
command = &quot;hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL --buildFuture&quot;</code></pre>
<div id="sidenote-drafts" class="section level4">
<h4>Sidenote: Drafts</h4>
<p>You can mark a post as a draft by setting <code>draft: true</code> in the post’s YAML.
This might even be the default when you create a new post (depending on your theme and settings).</p>
<p>But I don’t recommend using this flag for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it’s likely that you’ll forget to remove it before publishing.
The local live preview will show your post, so it’s easy to push your post only to discover that you forgot to set <code>draft: false</code> when your post doesn’t appear on your site.</p>
<p>Second, you can achieve the same results by writing and preparing your post in a post-specific pull request.
This keeps your source code, writing, and image in a self-contained branch in your repository (so you can get back to it later if it takes some time to finish it) and it allows you to take advantage of Netlify’s deploy preview feature.</p>
<p>If you want to use hugo’s draft post feature, you can also add <code>--buildDrafts</code> to the hugo command above so that Netlify renders draft posts on deploy previews.

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<div id="start-in-a-new-branch" class="section level3">
<h3>Start in a new branch</h3>
<p>Create a new branch for your post.
Give your branch a meaningful name; consider using the slug (short title) for the post.
I wrote this post in a branch called <code>post-new-post-workflow</code>.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="new-branch.png" alt="Create a New Branch with the an informative name, like post-&lt;slug&gt;." class="center" />
<p class="caption">Create a New Branch with the an informative name, like <code>post-&lt;slug&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="create-a-new-post" class="section level3">
<h3>Create a new post</h3>
<p>Create a new post in your blog using <span class="pkg">blogdown</span>’s <strong>New Post</strong> addin.
This is generally the easiest way to get started with a post, although you can also manually call <code>blogdown::new_post()</code> from the R command prompt.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="new-post_dropdown_crop.png" alt="Opening the New Post RStudio addin." class="center" />
<p class="caption">Opening the <strong>New Post</strong> RStudio addin.</p>
</div>
<p>At this step, the default date of the post is set to the current date.
If you’d like to “schedule” your post for a day in the future, you set the date now.
(While recognizing it’s an asipirational goal and not a hard-deadline.)</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="new-post_choose-future-date_crop.png" alt="Set the post date to be sometime in the future. (It was 2019-03-15 when I took this picture.)" class="center" style="width:66.0%" />
<p class="caption">Set the post date to be sometime in the future. (It was 2019-03-15 when I took this picture.)</p>
</div>
<p>You can also use <code>publishDate</code> or separately set <code>publishDate</code> and <code>date</code>.
If you use <code>publishDate</code>, the post will not be rendered until on or after the <code>publishDate</code>, but once published the post will appear to have been written on <code>date</code> (although this depends on the settings of your hugo theme).
This configuration parameter needs to be set in your post’s YAML header.</p>
<p>If you’re writing your posts in R Markdown with the <code>.Rmd</code> extension, another option is to set <code>date</code> in the post YAML header to</p>
<pre class="yaml"><code>date: &#39;2019-03-17&#39;</code></pre>
<p>to make the post’s date reflect the day your <code>.Rmd</code> was rendered to hugo’s HTML.
While I like this idea in theory, you may later need to re-render your post due to changes on your site.
If you use your post’s date in your site’s permalinks<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> — for example, with URLs like <code>/2019/03/18/bloggdown-netlify-new-post-workflow</code> — then this change may inadvertently change your sites URLs and invalidate links you’ve previously shared.</p>

<img src="new-post_addin-ready_crop.png" alt="Fill out the rest of your post information." class="center" style="width:66.0%" />
<p class="caption">Fill out the rest of your post information.</p>
</div>
<p>Run <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code> and write your post draft, previewing locally as you write.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
</div>
<div id="commit-and-push" class="section level3">
<h3>Commit and Push</h3>
<p>Commit your post when you’re complete or after you’ve written a section or a draft version (commits are cheap!).
When you have at least one commit in your post branch, say your draft post, push those commits to GitHub.
Navigate to the GitHub page for your website repo and <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request">open a pull request</a> from your post branch.</p>
<p>When you do you’ll see a yellow dot next to the most recent commit.
When it turns into a green checkmark, your preview is ready.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="netlify-pr-preview-complete.png" alt="Your deploy preview is ready on Netlify!" class="center" />
<p class="caption">Your deploy preview is ready on Netlify!</p>
</div>
<p>Click on the checkmark and then click on <em>Details</em>.
this will take you to a preview of your website at a url like <code>https://deploy-preview-&lt;pr#&gt;--&lt;website-name&gt;.netlify.com/</code></p>
<p>This site works exactly like it will when fully deployed, except for the two details that we changed above in <a href="#netlify-toml"><code>netlify.toml</code></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Internal links produced by Hugo will point to <code>deploy-preview-NN...netlify.com</code> rather than your <code>baseurl</code> address.</p></li>
<li><p>Future posts (and draft posts, if enabled) will be rendered as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="publish" class="section level3">
<h3>Publish</h3>
<p>The final step is to publish your post — merge your pull request to master and Netlify will deploy your site!</p>
<p>Of course, if you’ve scheduled your post for a future release date, it’s slightly more complicated.
I’m not aware of any strategy for automatically merging the pull request, so you have two options:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Wait until on or after the date of your post to merge the pull request to master.
Netlify will build and deploy your website immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>Merge your pull request, but then later use the Netlify settings page for your site to trigger a rebuild.
This seems more complicated to me, so I recommend using the first option.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t forget to share your post online!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Sidenote: Permalinks</p>
<p>Another quick sidenote to say that I highly recommend setting your permalinks to simply refer to your post’s slugs.
For some reason, I used the full year, month, <em>and day!</em> of my post in my permalinks.</p>
<p>But I certainly do not post often enough that I would ever end up with a name clash that could only be resolved by the full date of the post.
There is an incredibly small (and only <em>slightly</em> non-zero) chance I’ll use the same slug for two posts.
In my view, it’s a worthwhile risk and much nicer to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>not need to worry about the date in your posts’ URLs and</li>
<li>be able to share links like <a href="https://garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/" class="uri">https://garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/</a> than <a href="https://garrickadenbuie.com/blog/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/">https://garrickadenbuie.com/blog/2019/03/18/blogdown-netlify-new-post-workflow/</a>.</li>
