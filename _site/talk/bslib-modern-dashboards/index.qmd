## Abstract

> With increasing adoption of Streamlit to create interactive data applications in the usage of generative AI technologies, a challenge of maintaining responsiveness under heavy or concurrent user interactions has emerged as applications grow in complexity, sometimes with a long-running background job. This is where integrating task queueing systems like Redis Queue (RQ) into Streamlit applications can come in handy.
>
> In this talk, we will explore how we can enable this integration between RQ and Streamlit to achieve concurrency, improve user experiences and effectively manage long-running tasks.
