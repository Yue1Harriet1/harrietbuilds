I had a great time connecting with old and new friends and colleagues this past week at the [INFORMS 2017 Annual Meeting](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/houston2017/).

I was happy to have been invited by [Julie Hammett](https://twitter.com/JulieLHammett) to present in the *Remote Patient Monitoring and mHealth Applications* session Wednesday afternoon.

For those who are interested or couldn't make the session due to timing, I've posted a copy of my slides -- [Occupant Activity Profiles from Smart Home Sensor Event Streams](http://garrickadenbuie.com/slides/informs2017/) -- for you.

Some of the highlights from this INFORMS include:

- Dr. Baraniuk's talk on Deep Learning, especially his take on how we learn to train deep neural networks.

- The INFORMS Chapter of USF winning *Summa Cum Laude* by continuing events and programs that I worked on as President of the INFORMS chapter several years ago.

- Spending a night out in Houston on my birthday, reconnecting with friends who have graduated.

- Using Houston's bike share system to get around.

- And all of the many conversations I had with other graduate students.

Thanks INFORMS and Houston for a great trip!
