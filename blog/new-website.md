Well hello there.

I'm not exactly new to blogging. I've started plenty of blogs in my life. Each new blog is an empty notebook, full of promise of a new project, a new stream of ideas, a new list of things to do, a new stream of creative surges and the vast empty space of 100 blank pages to hold them all.

But my notebooks are only half full. (Or is it half empty?) I never seem to make it all the way through before a new notebook comes along, or a new project or turn in my life creates a thematic change that requires breaking out of the old patterns of the old notebook.

So let's hope this online notebook gets some notes. In the mean time, why not ~~stalk me~~ find out what I'm up to on [twitter](http://twitter.com/grrrck)
