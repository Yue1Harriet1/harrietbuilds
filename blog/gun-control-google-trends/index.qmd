**tl;dr:** Google searches for "gun control" after the shooting in
Parkland, Florida seem to be [similar to search trends after other
shootings](#this-time), although it could be different this time.

A civilized, modern society should be able to function nearly entirely
without guns. We should be able to go about our lives without ever
thinking about guns. We should be able to go the school, to go to
church, to go to the grocery store, to leave our house and move about in
the world without ever thinking about guns. Without ever having to worry
about a gun, by accident or intention, ending your life or the lives of
your loved ones.

We face a [public health crisis unique to our country
alone](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts)
with respect to gun violence. We are inflicting pain and economic burden
on ourselves at [a yearly cost of \$229
billion](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/04/true-cost-of-gun-violence-in-america/)
-- equivalent to the size of Portgual's economy. It is pointless,
devastating, entirely unnecessary and utterly heart breaking.

I very clearly remember Columbine as an inflection point in education in
my childhood, bomb threats and fire drills replacing class time like
DVDs replacing VHS. Columbine happened 1,700 miles away from my middle
school, but we felt it, even within the bubble of privelege that
surrounded my community. I cannot even begin to fathom how today's
children feel the gun violence they see around them.

It absolutely breaks my heart that they have to go through this. It
breaks my heart that the "adults" in our society can't get our shit
together. It breaks my heart that they have to fight so hard to be heard
and protected, that we need them to keep fighting, that we need them to
stand up and speak out when we should be comforting them, when we should
have done something sooner.

[ In their darkest hours, we are asking too much of them. And yet we
need them. How else will this ever change?

Yesterday, [Nate Silver](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538) put words to
our collective hope that this time something is different, that we're
getting closer to [#NeverAgain](https://twitter.com/NeverAgainMSD).

My first thought was *how do you know?*. What does the "fade" look like?
Clearly, I wasn't alone as a lot of other people pointed this out in
replies.

I did a quick search and found the
[gtrendsR](https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR) package on Github.
(Thank you Philippe Massicotte and Dirk Eddelbuettel.) What follows is
an analysis of Google Search trends for the term "gun control" before
and after other mass shooting events.

## Source Code

A quick note. All of the source code for this post can be found in my
[Github repo for this
website](https://github.com/gadenbuie/garrickadenbuie-com/blob/main/content/blog/2018/2018-02-18-gun-control-google-trends.Rmd_source).
I didn't include it here in part because it's a mess and also in part
because I used caching and some unusual data types to store the Google
Trends results.


## Mass Shootings Database

A dataset on mass shootings in the U.S. is available thanks to the hard
work of Kaggle user [zusmani](https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani). They
compiled a list of mass shootings in the U.S. since 1966, using public
datasets and webpages including
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States_by_year),
[Mother
Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/),
[Stanford](https://library.stanford.edu/projects/mass-shootings-america),
and [USA
Today](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html#title).

The data is available on Kaggle at
<https://www.kaggle.com/zusmani/us-mass-shootings-last-50-years/> and
includes a variety of variables.

For historical comparison, I selected the 15 most deadly shootings since
2004 (earliest available dates in Google Trends). Note that total
victims include casualties and injuries.

## Query Google Trends from R with gtrendsR {#query-google-trends}

Then I queried Google Trends via
[gtrendsR](https://github.com/PMassicotte/gtrendsR) for the search terms
`"gun control"` and a reference term for

-   The last 7 days (capturing Parkland, FL shooting)
-   One week before and 3 weeks after each of the above events
-   All search interest since 2004.

There are two points to note when working with data from Google Trends.

**First**, Google Trends returns search trends relative to the time
period queried, so it can be hard to determine the scale of interest
when looking at a smaller time period, such as a month. For comparison,
I included the reference term `"baseline"` because this is relatively
stable at \~10% from 2004 through present day[^1].
 **Edit 2018-02-20:** I replaced `"difficult"` with `"baseline"` as the comparison search term.

**Second**, the data returned by Google Trends is aggregated according
to the time window specified. In my tinkering I noticed that hourly
trends are only available for the last 7 days. Earlier data is always
aggregated at least by day. Longterm trends (such as the all time trend)
are aggregated by month.

The code below isn't exactly the code I used to gather the data, but it
should give you an idea for how easy it is to use gtrendsR.

``` r
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(gtrendsR)

get_trends_for_event <- function(day) {
  gtrends(
      keyword = c("gun control", "baseline"),
      geo = "US",
      time = paste(glue::glue("{day - 7} {day + 21}"))
    )
}

guntrends <- selected_dates %>%
    mutate(gtrends = map(Date, get_trends_for_event))

all_guntrends <- gtrends(c("gun control", "baseline"),
                         geo = "US", time = "all")

parkland_trends <- gtrends(c("gun control", "baseline"),
                           geo = "US", time = "now 7-d")
```

## All time search interest in "gun control" {#all-time}

Google searches for "gun control" are relatively low-volume in the
United States, with a clear increase around any mass shooting event. The
plot below shows search interest in "gun control" since 2004, with the
largest peak occurring after the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass
shooting.

![](figures/plot-gun-control-trends-1.png)

## Searching for "gun control" after a mass shooting

To examine Google search trends around individual mass shooting events,
I looked at searches for "gun control" within a one month window around
the shooting.

Each subplot shows search trends as reported by Google Trends on a
"scale" from 0 to 100. The scale of searching is relative to the time
period queried. Events such as the [Las Vegas
Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Las_Vegas_shooting), [Orlando
Night Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting),
[Aurora Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting)
shootings show how the events caught the attention of the public and led
to questions about our gun laws. Other events, such as the [Fort Hood
Army Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Fort_Hood_shooting) attack
seemed not to have caught public or media attention in the same way.

![](figures/plot-relative-1.png)

The above plot highlights search trends around individual mass shooting
events, but it's difficult to assess how strong the response to a
particular event is relative to previous events.

The approach that I worked out is to use a baseline search term that is
relatively constant across the entire period. As I discussed above, I
picked `"baseline"` for this role, as it nicely fits the bill. For each
query of Google Trends, I also requested search trends for `"baseline"`.
Then I scaled the `"gun control"` search trends relative to the hits on
the baseline search.

What this means is that in the following plot, the search volume for
`"gun control"` is shown in "units" of searches for `"baseline"`. A
value of 10 means there are 10 times more search for `"gun control"`,
whereas a value of 1 means that the search volumen is roughly
equivalent.

![](figures/plot-normed-baseline-1.png)

## Is this time different? {#this-time}

I certainly hope so. If we isolate other events with a similar profile
in terms of public perception, it seems possible that this time will be
different. But it also seems too early to tell.

In the mean time, just remember that Google searches aren't real things.
If you want to make a difference or a change, support a local
politician, donate to gun violence research, and register your friends
to vote. For more ideas, take a look at [Everytown's Action
Plan](https://everytown.org/throwthemout/) at

I'll close with this tweet from [\@davepell](https://twitter.com/davepell).

But first, to the victims in Parkland, Florida and the victims of gun
violence across the United States, I want you to know that **I hear you,
and I stand with you.**

#### Edits

**2018-02-20:** I changed the comparison term from `"difficult"` to
`"baseline"`. Also updated the scripts to gather data from the week
prior to Feb 14, 2018.

[^1]: It turns out that it's actually rather tough to find a "stable" search term within the same general order of magnitude of searches as "gun control". The term `"difficult"` was not selected un-ironically (initally). Later I decided there was too much variation in the search trends for `"difficult"` and thought that following the irony was a good idea. So I changed the term to `"baseline"`. Anyway, try it for yourself -- go to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=gun%20control,difficult) and see if you can find another non-seasonal, nearly zero-growth search term.
