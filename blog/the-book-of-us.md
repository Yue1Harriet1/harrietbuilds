My little sister got married in November (and then turned 24 in December), so I wrote her a birthday/belated wedding song for her and her new husband. <!-- more -->

## The Book of Us

The book began as an empty page \
I held the pen in my hand like a weather vane \
Then you walked in to my masquerade \
And that's where we begin

Our chapter opens in a cave \
When you stepped in to get out of the rain \
I gave you a made up name \
But you played me at my game

When I turn the page, we're in a park \
Reading words written from the heart \
In the setting sun I'm a question mark \
Quivering in the dark

Will you set me free when you're lying next to me? \
Will time step aside when you say that you are mine? \
Will I read it in your eyes?

Suddenly my life is a cosmic blur \
Of the city streets that we explore \
Discovering what the word love is for \
When I hold you in my arms

Then our chapter comes to its end \
With sad goodbyes and I'll see you when \
I'll hold you in my heart till then \
And we'll write our book again

*Chorus*

But time knows better than we do, we do \
I never lost my state of mind when I'm with you \
I will always find my way to you, find me way back to you \
Here you're standing next to me, I pledge my life to you \
I read your words and know that...

*Chorus*
