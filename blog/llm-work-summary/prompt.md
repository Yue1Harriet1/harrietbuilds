Summarize my work over the last week for a team update in prose.
Focus more on pull requests; issues are less important and just provide context.
Write in prose with full paragraphs.
Focus on the user impact of the work first and secondarily on the internal impact of dev changes.

Summarize the work using markdown under two headings:
'## Professional Work' and '## Personal Work'.
Include direct links to any mentioned pull requests using markdown syntax.
Use the first-person and try to sound like me.
